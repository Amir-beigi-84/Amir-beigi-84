# Flutter Clean Architecture Layout

This folder tree was generated by `tools/flutter_clean_architecture.sh`. It
contains opinionated defaults for a Clean Architecture layout that separates
Data, Domain, and Presentation concerns.

- **core** - app-wide abstractions such as environment configuration, failures,
  network helpers, and base use cases.
- **data** - concrete data sources, models, and repository implementations.
- **domain** - pure Dart business logic: entities, repository interfaces, and
  use cases.
- **presentation** - UI layer split into state management (`cubit`), pages, and
  widgets.
- **services** - entry point for dependency injection, observers, or platform
  facades.
- **test/src** - mirrors the `lib/src` structure for focused testing.

The generated `example_*` files are placeholders that show how to wire the
layers together. Replace or remove them as you adapt the structure to your
project.
